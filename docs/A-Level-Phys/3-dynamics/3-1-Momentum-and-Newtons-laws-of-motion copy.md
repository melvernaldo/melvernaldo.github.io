# 3.1. Momentum and Newton's Laws of Motion

{:.lo}
> 1. understand that mass is the property of an object that resists change in motion
> 1. recall F = ma and solve problems using it, understanding that acceleration and resultant force are always in the same direction
> 1. define and use linear momentum as the product of mass and velocity
> 1. define and use force as rate of change of momentum
> 1. state and apply each of Newton’s laws of motion
> 1. describe and use the concept of weight as the effect of a gravitational field on a mass and recall that the weight of an object is equal to the product of its mass and the acceleration of free fall
