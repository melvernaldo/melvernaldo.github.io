## **1.1. Physical quantities**

{: .objectives}
> 1. understand that all physical quantities consist of a numerical magnitude and a unit
> 2. make reasonable estimates of physical quantities included within the syllabus


## **1.2. SI units**

{: .objectives}
> 1. recall the following SI base quantities and their units: mass (kg), length (m), time (s), current (A), temperature (K)
> 2. express derived units as products or quotients of the SI base units and use the derived units for
quantities listed in this syllabus as appropriate
> 3. use SI base units to check the homogeneity of physical equations
> 4. recall and use the following prefixes and their symbols to indicate decimal submultiples or multiples of
both base and derived units: pico (p), nano (n), micro (μ), milli (m), centi (c), deci (d), kilo (k), mega (M),
giga (G), tera (T)

## **1.3. Errors and uncertainties**

{: .objectives}
> 1. understand and explain the effects of systematic errors (including zero errors) and random errors in
measurements
> 2. understand the distinction between precision and accuracy
> 3. assess the uncertainty in a derived quantity by simple addition of absolute or percentage uncertainties

## **1.4. Scalars and vectors**

{: .objectives}
> 1. understand the difference between scalar and vector quantities and give examples of scalar and vector quantities included in the syllabus
> 2. add and subtract coplanar vectors
> 3. represent a vector as two perpendicular components
