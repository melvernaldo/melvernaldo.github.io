## **2.1. Equations of motion**

{: .lo }
> 1. define and use distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration
> 2. use graphical methods to represent distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration
> 3. determine displacement from the area under a velocity–time graph
> 4. determine velocity using the gradient of a displacement–time graph
> 5. determine acceleration using the gradient of a velocity–time graph
> 6. derive, from the definitions of velocity and acceleration, equations that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line
> 7. solve problems using equations that represent uniformly accelerated motion in a straight line, including the motion of bodies falling in a uniform gravitational field without air resistance
> 8. describe an experiment to determine the acceleration of free fall using a falling object
> 9. describe and explain motion due to a uniform velocity in one direction and a uniform acceleration in a perpendicular direction
