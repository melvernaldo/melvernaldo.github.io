**<a href="/docs/Testing-Apps/circuitjs/circuitjs.html">Full Screen version</a>**

This is an electronic circuit simulator applet written by [Paul Falstad](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/) and [Iain Sharp](http://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/).

Check out Paul's web page for the offline version [here](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/).

For a manual/documentation on how to use the applet, check out
<a href="https://www.falstad.com/circuit/doc/" target="blank">this page</a>.

When the applet starts up you will see an animated schematic of a simple LRC circuit. The green color indicates positive voltage. The gray color indicates ground. A red color indicates negative voltage. The moving yellow dots indicate current.

To turn a switch on or off, just click on it. If you move the mouse over any component of the circuit, you will see a short description of that component and its current state in the lower right corner of the window. To modify a component, move the mouse over it, click the right mouse button (or control-click if you have a Mac) and select “Edit”.

The "Circuits" menu contains a lot of sample circuits for you to try.
