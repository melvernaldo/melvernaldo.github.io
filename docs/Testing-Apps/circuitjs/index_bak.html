      This is an electronic circuit simulator applet written by <a href="https://www.falstad.com/circuit/">Paul
         Falstad</a> and <a href="http://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/">Iain Sharp</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
      Check out Paul's web page for the offline version <a href="https://www.falstad.com/circuit/">here</a>.

      When the applet starts up you will see
      an animated schematic of a simple LRC circuit. The green
      color indicates positive voltage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>The gray color indicates ground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>A red color indicates negative voltage.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The moving yellow dots indicate current.</p>
   </p>
   <p>To turn a switch on or off, just click on it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>If you move the mouse over any component of the circuit, you
      will see a short description of that component and its current state in the
      lower right corner of the window.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To
      modify a component,
      move the mouse over it, click the right mouse button (or control-click
      if you have a Mac) and select &#8220;Edit&#8221;.</p>
   </p>
   <p>
      The "Circuits" menu contains a lot of sample circuits for you to try.
