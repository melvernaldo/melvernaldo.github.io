{:.lo}
> 1. explain and use the principle of superposition
> 2. show an understanding of experiments that demonstrate stationary waves using microwaves, stretched strings and air columns (it will be assumed that end corrections are negligible; knowledge of the concept of end corrections is not required)
> 3. explain the formation of a stationary wave using a graphical method, and identify nodes and antinodes
> 4. understand how wavelength may be determined from the positions of nodes or antinodes of a stationary wave
