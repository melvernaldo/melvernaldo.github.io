> 1. recall and use $d \sin\theta = n \lambda$
> 2. describe the use of a diffraction grating to determine the wavelength of light (the structure and use of the spectrometer are not included)

* A diffraction grating consists of a large number of very thin, equally spaced parallel slits carved into a glass plate

$$n \lambda = d \sin \theta_n$$
where:

- $n$ is the order of the spectrum
- $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the light
- $d$ is the distance between the slits
- $\theta_n$ is the angle of the $n$-th order spectrum

* The first order spectrum is the one closest to the central maximum

![diffraction-grating-spectrum](/docs/assets/images/diffraction-grating-spectrum.svg)

* The diffraction grating can be used to determine the wavelength of light by measuring the angle of the spectrum and the distance between the slits

![diffraction-grating-spectrometer](/docs/assets/images/diffraction-grating-spectrometer.svg)

* The spectrometer is used to measure the angle of the spectrum

![diffraction-grating-spectrometer-2](/docs/assets/images/diffraction-grating-spectrometer-2.svg)

* The spectrometer is calibrated using a light source of known wavelength (e.g. sodium light)

![diffraction-grating-spectrometer-3](/docs/assets/images/diffraction-grating-spectrometer-3.svg)

* The wavelength of the unknown light source can then be determined using the equation $n \lambda = d \
