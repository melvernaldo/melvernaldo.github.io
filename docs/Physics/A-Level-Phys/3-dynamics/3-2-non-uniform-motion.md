# 3.2. Non-uniform Motion

{:.lo}
> 1. show a qualitative understanding of frictional forces and viscous/drag forces including air resistance (no treatment of the coefficients of friction and viscosity is required, and a simple model of drag force increasing as speed increases is sufficient)
> 1. describe and explain qualitatively the motion of objects in a uniform gravitational field with air resistance
> 1. understand that objects moving against a resistive force may reach a terminal (constant) velocity
