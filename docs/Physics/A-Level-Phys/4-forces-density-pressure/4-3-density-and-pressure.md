> 1. define and use density
> 1. define and use pressure
> 1. derive, from the definitions of pressure and density, the equation for hydrostatic pressure \\( \Delta p = \rho g \Delta h \\)
> 1. use the equation \\( \Delta p = \rho g \Delta h \\)
> 1. understand that the upthrust acting on an object in a fluid is due to a difference in hydrostatic pressure
> 1. calculate the upthrust acting on an object in a fluid using the equation \\( F = \rho g V \\) (Archimedes’ principle)
