# [**melvernaldo.github.io**](./)

This website is my personal knowledge base for physics and mathematics. In addition to CIE IGCSE and A Level of physics and maths, I am aiming to also include higher level concepts of the subjects as well.

This site is still a ***work-in-progress*** and will be updated as time goes on to include more articles.

## Navigating this site

You are expected to primarily navigate this site using the sidebar (burger menu) for desktop users (phone users).

There is also a search feature to find articles on the site.

## Testing MathJax

$$ \grad f(x,y,z) = \pdv{f}{x} \vu{x} + \pdv{f}{y} \vu{y} + \pdv{f}{z} \vu{z} $$
